## Purpose

This app would be designed to allow students to post ideas about topics being explored in class in one location. This would allow students in a class to post their helpful ideas for other students to see and reference so everyone can document their learning together.

Posts would be persisted for a topic and stored for future viewing. Every post can receive positive feedback and can be commented on. A certain number of votes for a topic would contribute to achievements for a user.

Teachers setup classes and students can add themselves. Teachers can also add ideas and topic posts, just like students.
